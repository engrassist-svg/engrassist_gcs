                        <p class="content-text">
                            EngrAssist was founded with a simple mission: to provide professional-grade design tools that are both powerful and accessible. As practicing engineers in the commercial building design industry, we've experienced firsthand the challenges of finding reliable, easy-to-use calculation tools that meet the rigorous demands of modern engineering design.
                        </p>

                        <p class="content-text">
                            Too often, engineers find themselves recreating the same calculations in spreadsheets or struggling with overly complex software for simple tasks. We saw an opportunity to bridge this gap by creating web-based tools that combine professional accuracy with intuitive design.
